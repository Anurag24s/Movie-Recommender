## Data Analysis
The recommendation system is built on a dataset of over 5000 movies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the data analysis process:

### Data Collection: The dataset includes detailed information about each movie, such as title, genre, director, cast, and more.
### Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
### Feature Extraction: Relevant features were extracted from the dataset to build the recommendation model. These features include movie titles, genres, and other metadata.
